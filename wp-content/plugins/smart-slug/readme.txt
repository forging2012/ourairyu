Smartify your post, page, tag and category slugs by removing too short or insignificant stopwords automatically.

== Description ==

Smartify your post, page, tag and category slugs and let them convey the very essence of your content's titles by removing too short or insignificant stopwords - automatically, that is. **Smart Slug** comes preloaded with an easily expandable and configurable set of German, Dutch, Russian, Portuguese and English stopwords.
